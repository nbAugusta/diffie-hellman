# diffie-hellman
A simple object-oriented implementation of Diffie-Hellman key exchange in Python.

## Basic Usage
* The main() function requires the user enter a prime number corresponding to the order of the finite field used to facilitate the key exchange (ex. 23), in addition to a generator of that finite field, before beginning key exchange (ex. for the finite field $$\mathbb{Z}_{23}$$, 5 can be given as a generator).
